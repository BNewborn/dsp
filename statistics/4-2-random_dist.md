[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform? 

Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?

```
thousand_randos = np.random.random(1000)
```
# Creating the PMF
```
rando_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(thousand_randos, label='randos')

thinkplot.Hist(rando_pmf, align='right', width=width)

thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random floats 0-1', ylabel='PMF')
```

The PMF is essentially useless here - we cannot tell what numbers are getting chosen and what numbers aren't. This is because each random number chosen by np.random.random is going to be an extremely long decimal; the odds of getting 2 identical numbers are close to 0. So, each separate value is technically being recorded as a distinct outcome, when we'd probably (for illustrative purposes) be better off grouping numbers rounded to the nearest hundredth (or something similar). 

# Creating the CDF


Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?
```

rando_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(thousand_randos, label='randos')

thinkplot.Cdf(rando_cdf)

thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random floats 0-1', ylabel='CDF')
```

The CDF is a much better represntation of this dataset, as you can see a close-to-smooth line from the bottom left to the top right of the graph. This is telling us that the distribution is quite close to uniform, as the probability of getting a slightly higher number increases almost at a 1-1 relationship with the increase in np.random.random
