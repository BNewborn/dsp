[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform? 

Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?

```
thousand_randos = np.random.random(1000)
```
# Creating the PMF
```
rando_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(thousand_randos, label='randos')

thinkplot.Hist(rando_pmf, align='right', width=width)

thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random floats 0-1', ylabel='PMF')
```

# PMF IMAGE HERE

# Creating the CDF

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?
```

rando_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(thousand_randos, label='randos')

thinkplot.Cdf(rando_cdf)

thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random floats 0-1', ylabel='CDF')
```
